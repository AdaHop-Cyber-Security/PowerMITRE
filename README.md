# MITRE ATT&CK Automated Pentest Framework

**Author:** Pin3apple  
**Date:** 2025-02-02

> **WARNING:** Use this framework **only** on systems you are explicitly authorized to test. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.

## Overview

This professional PowerShell framework performs automated penetration testing by:

- **Downloading** the latest MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise JSON bundle.
- **Enumerating** every technique (attack-pattern) defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Executing** an automated test for each technique where available. For techniques without an automated test, a placeholder function logs that manual review is recommended.
- **Logging** detailed output for later review.

The framework is designed to be modular, with secure logging and error handling, making it suitable for authorized real-life penetration testing engagements.

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell Version:** Tested on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7+.
- **Internet Access:** Required on the first run to download the MITRE ATT&CK JSON bundle.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have explicit authorization to test the target system.

## Parameters

- **`-TargetHost`**:  
  The target hostname or IP address on which automated tests will be executed.

- **`-LogFile`** (Optional):  
  Full path to a log file. If not specified, the default log file is `.\PentestLog.txt`.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** the repository containing the framework.
2. **Open PowerShell** and navigate to the repository directory.
3. **Run the script** using the required parameters.

### Basic Example

Run the framework against a target IP:

```powershell
.\PentestFramework.ps1 -TargetHost 192.168.1.100
```

This command will:

- Check for a locally cached copy of the MITRE ATT&CK JSON file.  
- Download the JSON bundle if it is not already present.
- Enumerate all attack-patterns (techniques) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Execute automated tests (or log a recommendation for manual review) for each technique.
- Write detailed logs to the default file `.\PentestLog.txt`.

### Custom Log File Example

You can specify a custom location for the log file:

```powershell
.\PentestFramework.ps1 -TargetHost example.com -LogFile "C:\Logs\PentestFramework.log"
```

This command will execute the tests on `example.com` and store the log entries in `C:\Logs\PentestFramework.log`.

## Script Structure

- **Parameters and Global Settings:**  
  Defines the required parameters and sets the URL for the MITRE ATT&CK JSON bundle.

- **Logging Function (`Write-Log`):**  
  Logs messages with timestamps and writes them to the designated log file.

- **Download and Parse Functions:**  
  - `Download-MitreAttackJson`: Downloads the JSON bundle.
  - `Parse-MitreAttackJson`: Parses the downloaded JSON file.

- **Automated Test Functions:**  
  A collection of functions that implement tests for various techniques.  
  - **Implemented tests:** e.g., `Test-NetworkServiceScanning`, `Test-PowerShellEnvironment`, `Test-CommandLineInterface`.  
  - **Placeholder tests:** e.g., `Test-CredentialDumping`, `Test-ValidAccounts`, etc., which recommend manual testing.

- **Technique Invocation:**  
  The `Invoke-TechniqueTest` function maps each MITRE ATT&CK technique (by its external ID) to its corresponding test function.

- **Main Execution Block:**  
  Orchestrates the overall process: downloads/parses the JSON, iterates over each technique, and calls the respective test functions.

## Disclaimer

This framework is provided for **educational** and **authorized penetration testing** purposes only. Use it responsibly and always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any system.

*Happy Testing!*
